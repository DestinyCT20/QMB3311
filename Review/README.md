# Python for Business Analytics: Final Exam Review

The latter half of the course has revolved around solving problems with the tools that we have used in the first half of the course. 
All of the building blocks, 
such as the types of variables and what you can do with them, 
are used to solve problems. 
So, in that sense, all of the prior topics provide the necessary background. 
Computational problems are solved by creating software, one way or the other. 
We used a few ways of packaging software. 


# Creating Software


[The Function Design Recipe](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/02_Functions)

[Defining Your Own Modules](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/08_DesigningModules)

In the final exam, just as with the midterm exam, some of the answers will be
in the form of functions that are packaged within a module. 



# Algorithms

Your programs each solve a particular problem. 
We talked about the overall strategy for designing an algorithm. 

[Designing Algorithms](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/12_Algorithms)

We also discussed a few specific numerical calculations for which you can design algorithms.


## Optimization

### Multi-parameter Optimization with multiple loops 

[Assignment 5](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/Assignment_05)



### Algorithms designed for Optimization

See [Optimization](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/17_Optimization)
and 
[Assignment 7](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/Assignment_07), in which we let ```scipy``` do the work, 



### Solving equations


[Solving for Roots of Equations](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/13_Solving_Equations)

# Organizing Data

A large part of business analytics involves organizing data. 


## Data frames

[Data Preparation and Analysis](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/07_Modules)


## Databases

### Demo 23: 

[Introduction to Databases](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/20_Databases)

### Demo 24:

[Aggregation](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/21_Databases_Continued)



### Demo 25: 

Review the examples, however, using scripts are longer exercises best done after the exam.
One topic that is important because much of the value of learning
SQL derives from the ability to join multiple sources of data.

# Quality Assurance

In any programming exercise, it is important to make sure that
your program is correct and reliable. 
We have discussed concepts for developing reliable software throughout the course. 


## Testing Your Code Semiautomatically

[Testing with ```doctest```](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/QMB3311/tree/main/08_DesigningModules)



## Testing and Debugging

# Tips for the Exam

The format will be similar to that for the midterm exam, 
except it will be three hours in length, 
from 10:00 AM to 12:50 PM on Tuesday, May 2, 2022. 

- Computer-based, live programming exercise. 
- Some questions will be answered in the form of functions submitted within a module.
- Some questions will be stand-alone computations within a separate script. 
- Submissions are made through your GitHub repository. 
- Do not worry about submitting the url on Webcourses. 
That is not a good use of your time. By this point in the course, 
you should know where to put your solutions (a folder called ```final_exam```)
and I should know where to find them.
